# ðŸŽ„ ASCII Christmas tree

## Description

I heard about a fun little coding exercise to draw an ASCII Christmas tree given a hight of `n`. It gets you thinking about how long the line is, how many spaces are required to pad each line and how big the base on the tree should be.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites

Install Go using brew

```shell
brew install go
```

Clone the repositorty 

```shell
git clone
